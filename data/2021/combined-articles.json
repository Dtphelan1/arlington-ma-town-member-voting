In short, the proposed bylaw would not require excavation by “blasting.” It would however require that developers conduct an analysis of the feasibility of blasting, including engaging abutters within 250 feet before commencing an excavation of a magnitude of 50 or more cubic yards consistent with State Fire Safety standards. Projects of that scope have been the subject of increasing concern and complaints in recent years as rock-chipping and other mechanical means of excavation carry on for weeks or in extreme cases, months. It is important to note that “blasting” is already permitted by State law and should be conducted pursuant to extensive regulations, established in 527 CMR 1.00, summarized by a pamphlet from the State provided in the appendix to this report. The proposal before Town Meeting does not change anything about blasting requirements. In discussing this matter at hearing, some residents expressed concerns with blasting projects in their neighborhoods and reported that they were unaware of some of their rights. Such matters are outside the scope of this article, but this proposal provided opportunity for Town staff to examine those concerns and determine whether additional tools are available to persons with site specific issues under the Town or State’s present rules and regulations.",

In summary, the Article asserts that the resources of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund (“AHTF”) recently established at the November 2020 Special Town Meeting should be focused on those Arlington residents of greater needs – who have incomes at or lower than 60 % of the so-called “Area Median Income” (“AMI”). However, as was debated and discussed in developing the bylaw for the AHTF Board of Trustees at the November 2020 Town Meeting, many potential funding sources, partners, and worthy recipients, including the Community Preservation Act, Community Development Block Grants employ AMI standards with greater flexibility. To that point, AHTF funds are highly likely to be used to leverage further state, federal and private resources. Restricting yet to be appointed Trustees’ ability to fund projects that are eligible for those other resources could be counter-productive in unintended ways. Furthermore, one of the first tasks for the AHTF Board of Trustees will be developing a “Trust Action Plan” and identifying housing needs and priorities in Arlington through a process that will invite community engagement. In the Select Board’s experience, committees and commissions in these arenas prioritize funds well. Indeed the overwhelming majority, if not the all of affordable housing grants provided the Select Board and the Community Preservation Act Committee (through CDBG and CPA funds respectively) have been provided to projects supporting 60% or lower AMI residents as a matter of the choices of those respective bodies rather than a bylaw directing their priorities. The Select Board believes that we should afford the AHTF Board of Trustees the same discretion to formulate priorities and plans before the Town seeks to revise their charter bylaw only approved at the November Special Town Meeting.",

There may be some Town Meeting Members who do not make themselves accessible via email, but in the Board’s experience, many if not most Members establish a “TMM” email address for Meeting business separate from their personal or work email addresses. Some members of the Board expressed interest in exploring the issue further, including whether or not “alias” addresses would be technically feasible.  However, as Town Meeting knows, Meeting Members are not “municipal employees” in the same manner as town staff, other committee and commission members, or elected officials. The conflict-of-interest and open meeting laws do not apply to Town Meeting or its membership. In a similar vein, public records laws do not necessarily apply to Meeting Member communications while using personal email addresses. Using a Town administered email address could make communications between members or members and precinct residents public records. Moreover, providing Meeting Member Town email accounts would not require Meeting Members to necessarily utilize them, and may require significant tech support. Thus, the Select Board is not convinced that the benefits of this Article’s proposal outweigh new issues created by it.",

The Select Board is unanimous in its support for RCV in single seat elections.  In a standard race for a single seat with three or more candidates if any candidate obtains more than fifty percent of the votes in the first tabulation they are declared the winner. If not, the candidate with fewest “first-preference” votes is eliminated and those voter’s second choices are counted. This process of eliminating the candidate with fewest votes and elevating the next preference is repeated until two candidates remain. When two candidates remain, the candidate with the most votes — necessarily a majority of the votes in the final round — wins.  In a multi-seat election, the Select Board recommends a modification from previous proposals submitted to Town Meeting. The Select Board is recommending a ‘majoritarian” RCV approach (as opposed to the “proportional” model). The majoritarian RCV uses the same process as for a single-seat race, but that process is iterated as many times as there are open seats. After the first seat is filled, the winning candidate’s name is removed from choices and the process is repeated.  While there are some concerns about the need for further public outreach and unintended consequences of RCV, the majority of the Board believes that RCV, especially utilizing the majoritarian model, will allow voters to express more nuanced candidate preferences, make running for office more accessible, and enhance voter participation that better reflects voter positions.",

At the outset, it should be stressed that the proposal before Town Meeting, as recommended by the Housing Plan Implementation Committee is contingent upon 1) the Meeting’s approval; 2) a successful special act in the Legislature; and 3) a positive local ballot question vote to establish a fee.  If all of those approvals are gained, the Town would assess a fee of between .05 and 2.00 % of the total purchase and sale price of real estate in Arlington to benefit the specific and limited purpose of supporting AHTF projects. This Board would be charged with recommending to Town Meeting for vote or bylaw the minimum sale price for triggering application the transfer fee (for all eligible transactions, not on a case-by-case basis), apportioning responsibility for the fees, and setting the rate itself for all transactions, but many common transfers would be exempt. For example a transfer or property between immediate family where little or no financial consideration is involved would be exempt. Moreover, any transfer valued at under 100% of the statewide median sale price ($445,000 in 2020) would also be exempt. The benefits to affordable housing programs in Arlington, even at the lowest rates or applied to only higher value transactions would be substantial, as evidenced by this table provided by the Department of Planning and Community Development: (see chart in Select Board Report) Finally, the Select Board remains committed to sound management of all funds, including those placed in the AHTF through a transfer fee. The Board emphasizes the importance of the reporting requirements set forth in the transfer fee special legislation and expects the AHTF’s “Trust Action Plan” and related Town departments to identify how funds are expected to be prioritized and expended.",

                "comment": "The proposed amendments for the Industrial District are first and foremost to address the antiquated table of uses and density and dimensional requirements that are preventing the attraction of new and modern uses to Arlington’s Industrial Districts. The uses allowed in the Industrial District are wide ranging and are either hyper-specific by dedicating how floor area may be used or vague categories of uses that are necessary businesses but not reflective of the needs of potential industrial users. Now, many industrial users desire large flexible space with high ceilings in order to enable businesses to pivot their work as emerging markets and research change over time. The proposed amendments reflect specific recommendations from the Master Plan that reflect the current market needs for the wide range of industrial users.  The proposed zoning amendment adds new uses to the Table of Uses to include uses such as flex uses, artist live/work spaces, food production, vertical agriculture, breweries and the similar, larger restaurants, and storage facilities. These uses are in addition to and expand on the existing artistic and creative production uses that are currently allowed either by right or by special permit in the district. The proposed zoning amendment includes development standards for any new construction or additions greater than 50%, which acknowledge and support other efforts that are important to the Town. There is a significant emphasis placed on incorporating sustainability measures and stormwater management measures. Acknowledging that the industrial districts are in close proximity to residential districts, the standards also emphasize the need to develop human-scale buildings, pedestrian amenities, and consider building height within the context of the surrounding, often residential, neighborhood.  The proposed amendments are also aligned with the needs of the creative economy as described in the Arts and Culture Action Plan.1 Like the modern industrial business that desire flexible spaces, the proposed zoning amendments allow the creation of live/work spaces for the creative economy where the artist or maker can adjust their space to their current creative needs. The proposed zoning also acknowledges differences between artists and makers, ranging from a painter or a writer who may only need a small studio to someone who works with materials that by their nature requires a larger space by acknowledging these differences in the definitions and uses.  The ARB acknowledges that there were significant discussions about the desirability of including residential in mixed-use projects in the Industrial District. The Master Plan recommendation described above indicated that residential uses should be allowed in mixed-use projects where the associated commercial/industrial space comprises the majority of the usable space. Currently, the Zoning Bylaw strictly prohibits residential uses in mixed-use projects in the Industrial District. At the ARB meeting on December 21, 2020, representatives from RKG Associates and Harriman made a presentation that included a pro forma analysis. 2 RKG completed the pro forma analysis to determine whether the proposed amendments are realistic requirements to set on property owners and developers. RKG found that a new development of industrial and commercial uses alone may not pencil out for a property owner’s investment to develop or redevelop a site. When including residential uses, the pro forma does show profitability.  The ARB notes that since the first quarter of 2017, no industrial properties have been listed for sale in Arlington. With so much owner-occupied property and so little turnover in the industrial districts either through sale or lease, there has been little incentive for property owners to consider redeveloping their property to create opportunities to bring new and modern light industrial, research and development, manufacturing, and the creative economy to the Industrial Districts. The ARB determined that by allowing limited residential in mixed-use projects, property turnover may be incentivized by balancing the investment and requirements with some profitability, thus avoiding long term stagnation in the districts. The ARB believes that appropriate limitations are in place to not supplant industrial or commercial uses. The proposed zoning requires commercial and industrial uses to be the ground floor uses in any mixed-use project in the Industrial District. Additionally, residential floor area is tied to the floor area of the Light Industrial uses at a 1:1 ratio; any additional residential uses require further financial review by the ARB. Light industrial as written includes brewery, distillery, and winery, flex space, food production in addition to what is already allowed in the zoning. Therefore, residential cannot be included in any mixed-use project; it must be proportional to modern industrial uses.  Finally, the ARB notes that the proposed zoning amendments connect recommendations in the Arlington Heights Neighborhood Action Plan3, the Arts and Culture Plan, the Mill Brook Corridor Report4, and the Net Zero Action Plan5 with the Town’s Industrial Districts. The Arlington Heights Neighborhood Action Plan, in particular, recognized the fragmented nature of the Industrial Districts and recommended relaxing the Zoning Bylaw’s restrictive use and dimensional guidelines, including for “artistic/creative production.” The ARB notes that each of these plans were developed through strong participatory planning processes subsequent to the adoption of the Master Plan.",

It does not enable new home construction where an existing principal structure does not already exist.   Property owners who seek to reconstruct their home and foundation to the identified industry energy efficiency standards are allowed to reconstruct the foundation if the parcel has at least 5,000 square feet. If the property owner wants to include an addition of up to 750 square feet, the home and foundation can be reconstructed. If the property owner wants to include an addition of 750 square feet or more, the property owner will still need a special permit from the ZBA in accordance with Section 5.4.2.B(6) on Large Additions. A special permit is also needed if the lot has less than 5,000 square feet and there is an existing structure.  The Clean Energy Future Committee noted that the amendment makes Arlington property owners of non-conforming lots equally eligible as property owners of conforming lots for certain federal and state incentives and tax credits that are only available to those who build high efficiency homes.",

It would require that the uses in a mixed-use structure are only those that are allowed in the applicable Zoning District. The ARB believes that this article would limit flexibility in creating beneficial and creative projects that also fulfill community goals. Mixed-use projects are reviewed by the ARB through a discretionary Special Permit process. Compatibility of proposed uses is considered in relationship to the surrounding neighborhood as part of that process. The Master Plan recommends supporting vibrant commercial areas by encouraging mixed-use redevelopment. By limiting the uses that could be considered as part of a mixed-use development, this Warrant Article is inconsistent with the goals of the Master Plan. For example, providing housing units as part of a mixed- use development increases the economic viability of developments, allows the town to meet consumer demand by integrating a variety of uses into a single development project, improves the walkability of Arlington’s commercial districts, and allows with some constraints the ARB to incorporate locally strong performing sectors into projects.   The ARB does not believe that there is any ambiguity in the definition and, as such as, does not need any clarification. The ARB also notes that a substantive change to requirements should not be in the definitions section of the Zoning Bylaw, as is proposed in this article, but should be in a substantive section of the Bylaw.",

Instead, this article mandates the creation of only affordable housing for such conversion or expansion. As such, this Article would not achieve Arlington’s affordable housing or commercial development goals. Without offering any incentives, this Warrant Article would appear to deter rather than encourage the creation of affordable housing. This chilling effect is caused by limiting the flexibility property owners now have in reinvesting in properties in Arlington. If the only option available for residential space is to create affordable housing, a property owner may not be able to balance a pro forma to see a return on their investment in their property. Small-scale development of any type is challenging and costly, particularly creating a development with only affordable housing units. Further, the added requirement to seek a Special Permit creates another barrier to property owners reinvesting in buildings in Arlington, increasing time and costs. Lastly, the seemingly mandatory nature of requiring that one to five units of housing must be affordable in most mixed-use development is in direct conflict with the existing Zoning Bylaw’s Inclusionary requirements found in Section 8.2.  The cost of developing affordable housing often exceeds available local and state funding sources, even for projects that only have 10-20% of total housing units designated as affordable. Private developers recoup the cost of developing affordable housing in several ways: using inclusionary housing bonuses (e.g., height bonuses, unit bonuses) to offset the costs of providing affordable housing, charging more in rent or purchase costs for housing not designated as affordable housing, and applying for public subsidies (e.g., CDBG funding, CPA funding, housing trust funds, federal tax credits). These development scenarios include primarily market rate housing in order for a private developer to break even on a project, especially given limited public funding resources and subsidies.",

Words not defined in either place shall have the meaning given in the most recent edition of Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary.” The Massachusetts State Building Code (780 CMR) does not have a single definition for foundations, but rather devotes an entire chapter to this building component. This is due to the complex and multifactored conditions that require variations in regulations instead of a single blanket definition. The dictionary defines a foundation as “an underlying base or support.”   The ARB notes that municipalities refrain from cross referencing building code definitions in their zoning regulations. No comparative municipalities provide a definition of a foundation in their zoning bylaws or ordinances, and most explicitly defer to the State Building Code and then the dictionary for industry-specific terminology.",

This amendment is substantially different than the previous accessory dwelling unit proposals considered by Town Meeting, most recently at the 2020 Special Town Meeting and the 2019 Annual Town Meeting. In particular, the amendment considered by the 2019 Town Meeting required a special permit for the use and was limited to the R0 and R1 Zoning Districts; this amendment allows Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) by right in single- family, two-family, and duplex dwellings in any residential and commercial district. The amendment considered by the 2020 Special Town Meeting included a very different definition for ADUs that specified the number of rooms necessary and provided scant limits on the size of the ADU. This amendment brings together pieces of the 2019 and 2020 amendments that have been identified by the ARB previously. It also includes many safeguards to ensure that the small accessory units that would be authorized are safe and used only as the Bylaw intends.   ADUs provide many benefits to property owners: allow additional flexibility on using space within the home; allow for options that may create supplementary income; allow aging in place or multigenerational families on the property; and increase long-term rental housing opportunities while balancing potential impacts to existing neighborhoods. These benefits are consistent with the goals of the Housing Production Plan and are encouraged to facilitate a range of housing types to help meet the needs of specific demographics, such as seniors, multi-generational households, individuals with disabilities, low-to-middle income family households, and singles (p. 60).",

Article 44 extends this provision to the remaining business districts (B1, B2, B2A, and B4). The B1, B2, B2A, and B4 Zoning Districts are primarily located along Massachusetts Avenue and Broadway, with a few scattered parcels on Chestnut, Summer, Mystic, and Lowell Streets.   The existing parking requirements in the Zoning Bylaw can create a situation where the space required for off-site parking for a development or change of use can be almost as large the use itself. Private on- site parking also works against the Town’s commercial development goals. The bylaw requires approximately 153 square feet of parking space per vehicle—255 square feet if a driving aisle is required. Under this requirement, the owner of a 1,700 square foot property without on-site parking who wanted to change an existing use to “other retail or service use” would be required to provide six off-street parking space. The resulting parking lot would need to be 1,530 square feet, or 90% of the total Gross Floor Area (GFA) of the property.   Further, the current supply of on-street parking is often sufficient to meet or even exceed demand, even in the three primary commercial districts. The B1, B2, B2A, and B4 districts are located along the periphery or between of these busier commercial areas, with an adequate supply of on-street parking.   This article does not grant a reduction or completely remove parking requirements by right. Applicants must demonstrate a shared parking, off-site parking, and/or Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan per Section 6.1.5 of the Zoning Bylaw. Shared parking and TDM measures can help address employee parking; off-site parking can help address the need for customer or visitor parking. Through a Special Permit request, the ARB or ZBA can assess the applicant’s proposals, determine whether an applicant’s plan will offset the parking requirements, and evaluate over time if there will be a cumulative effect on parking availability in the business districts. This Article simply provides the Boards with greater flexibility and case-by-case consideration of parking adjustments beyond the currently allowable parking reduction, especially for a commercial change of use within existing storefronts.",

                "comment": "The ARB recognizes the need for more affordable housing in Arlington, but for the reasons stated below, believes that this proposal will not achieve that goal and may actually reduce the development of affordable housing in Arlington.   Section 8.2 of the Zoning Bylaw sets forth the affordable housing requirements for residential development in Arlington. Adopted by a vote of Town Meeting in 2001, the bylaw requires that 15% of any new residential development of six or more units (which is subject to Environmental Design Review) must be affordable to households earning 70% or 80% of Area Median Income (AMI) for rental units and ownership units, respectively. Housing units created through this measure must be affordable in perpetuity, built on site, and integrated into the development. To incentivize developers to build affordable units, the bylaw allows for reduced parking requirements. Since 2001, the bylaw has resulted in the development of 59 affordable housing units.    This Warrant Article seeks to raise Arlington’s affordable housing requirement for developments of six or more units from 15% to 25% without any corresponding changes to the incentive structure and without any supporting documentation that such a large increase would be viable in Arlington.   Under the proposed amendment, the four market rate units would need to cover the subsidy. This is a significant change, and one that economic analysts for other communities have suggested could discourage private investment, particularly for smaller multi-unit projects, or even backfire, resulting in fewer affordable units being built.   For Arlington, where the inclusion of affordable housing for developments of six or more units is already mandatory, the appropriate balance between incentives and requirements must be sought. If a pro forma for a project does not balance out, the affordable housing requirement, special permit requirements, and other conditions can undermine a development or lead a developer to choose to build something sufficiently small to not require the development of affordable units. If developing affordable housing through inclusionary zoning is overly restrictive, it may be more practical for a developer to apply for a permit through the Comprehensive Permit process (Chapter 40B) than through local inclusionary zoning provisions, or not work in Arlington at all as there are significant costs (time and money) to pursue a Comprehensive Permit.  In short, Arlington’s affordable housing requirements need to provide meaningful benefits and incentives to offset developers’ revenue losses. A threshold set too high, especially when accompanied by an extensive review and permitting process, may actually incentivize developers to build elsewhere. The ARB also notes this Board and the Select Board adopted the existing Housing Production Plan (HPP) in 2016, which laid out housing needs and demand, the development constraints, capacity, and opportunities, and an implementation plan consisting of housing goals and strategies to achieve them. The Housing Production Plan (HPP) update has kicked off. The broad engagement envisioned as part of that process would enable the community to have wide ranging conversations about what housing production in Arlington might look like, how it could be implemented, and where it should be focused in the community. It is expected that the HPP Update will take a close look at the structure of Arlington’s inclusionary housing bylaw and provide recommendations on how to balance the thresholds, percentages, and incentives for produce affordable housing. That is the appropriate process to determine if the percentage of required affordable housing can be increased, and, if so, to what new percentage.",

In brief, the purpose of the resolution is to encourage the Town to build upon the findings and recommendations of the 2020 MIT “Building a Better Broadway: Planning Study for the Broadway Corridor, Arlington MA” report by inviting design professionals to translate those recommendations into conceptual proposals for the Broadway Corridor in East Arlington. While the resolution is non- binding, it provides support for an effort that would likely require partnerships to realize, and helps to frame many of the important concerns frequently subject to debate across Town government.",

The Town is already a leader in providing public electric vehicle charging stations at a variety of locations such as the Gibbs School and Town Hall. However, the growing number of electric vehicles and the Town’s commitment to carbon neutrality merit further development and planning for stations distributed in an equitable way throughout the Arlington.   While the resolution is non-binding, cultivating the momentum of Town Meeting’s support is valuable for seeking both internal and external resources and financial planning. It should however be understood that such plans must of course exist within the restraints of the Capital Budget and availability of funds.",

While the resolution largely speaks for itself, the Board specifically wishes to highlight that the five “action steps” set forth in the resolution build upon the work and goals of the Town’s present Climate & Resiliency Planning and the Town Manager’s “Net Zero Plan,” while also reaffirming our convictions to build climate change into Town decision making within the respective boundaries of duties and authorities of various town bodies and officials. Further, this resolution follows previous efforts such as special legislation seeking to allow the Town to limit installation of fossil fuel infrastructure by urging the Town to continue to vigorously pursue new and additional tools and resources for greenhouse gas emission reductions and elimination. Finally, this resolution recognizes the fundamental role of equity and justice in attacking climate change and its impacts both locally and globally.  The Board also encourages members of Town Meeting to avail themselves of the many resources on this resolution and subject developed and published by “Emergency Arlington” on their website.",
