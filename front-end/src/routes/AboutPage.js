          Vote Smart Arlington is an effort to present Arlington, MA town member voting records in a novel and
          accessible way. Our site gives Arlington town residents the ability to select their precinct and view their
          town meeting members' voting history for all of 2020, which we hope will serve as an informational resource as
          we approach the municipal election on April 10, 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is not affiliated with the town government of Arlington in any way. While some of our data was
          sourced from publicly available data on the town government website (see below), this project and our approach
          to its presentation are purely our own.
